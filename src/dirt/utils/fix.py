class cached_property:
    """`functools.cached_property` without locks.

    Simple "backport" of perf improved cached_property in 3.12.

    Changed in version
    3.12: Prior to Python 3.12, cached_property included an undocumented lock to ensure
    that in multi-threaded usage the getter function was guaranteed to run only once per
    instance. However, the lock was per-property, not per-instance, which could result
    in unacceptably high lock contention. In Python 3.12+ this locking is removed.
